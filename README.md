This webpage is designed to illustrate the bioinformatics analysis workflow for the techniques mentioned in DDA (http://www.bioinformaticspa.com/DDA/).

It is worth noting that some techniques are classified as similar to ChIP-seq based on the library preparation methods.Therefore, they employ the same analysis methods.
These techniques are: DISCOVER-seq, MiDAS, SAR-seq, EdU-seq, BrdU-seq, OxiDIP-seq, OGAP-seq, OG-seq, AP-seq, OGG1-AP-seq, dU-seq, UPD-seq, U-DNA-seq, TCR-seq and RADD-seq.

For some techniques, we download the result file directly on GEO without mapping. Therefore, these techniques are not included in the source code. (Protec-seq, CC-seq)
